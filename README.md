- 👋 Hi, I’m @discocube
- 👀 I’m interested in making an awesome website that is fun, interactive, informative and inspiring for what can be done with 3d without too much lag time
- 🌱 I’m currently learning my own process of making a website.. ie.. how I turn simple ideas into bigger compositions while keeping the spirit of the unit
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on making my code alot faster and alot less verbose.. and learning how to better organize the information I want to present
- 📫 You can reach me at developer@discocube.org
